        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Clerick D. Barrion</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 WEB215-N801 Adv Markup and Scripting with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
        <p>Signed: <em>Clerick D. Barrion, 28 January 2025</em></p>
